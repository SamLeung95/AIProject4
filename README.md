K-means clustering

Supports reading points from text file.
One point per line.

Points can be written as:
(x,y)
x y

Run it with the following command:
python Clustering.py numberOfClusters file.txt


This program takes in points from a text file and uses k-means clustering to cluster the points into the specified amounts of clusters.
After clustering, it then displays the clusters with different markings and colors to differentiate between the groups.
